# weakgame-api
WEAKGAME - Is an "almost" fun game that can be used as a training platform or teaching resource for new developers. This repository is the backend REST (ish) API written in GO and generated by AUTOAPI

#### System requirements

* go1.4.2
* Properly setup go env

#### Setup
Once you have GO setup properly, proceed with setup

```
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/colingagnon
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/colingagnon
git clone https://github.com/colingagnon/weakgame-api.git
cd weakgame-api
```

Now you need to create a mysql database and user
Then import the file at: data/weakgame-api.sql

```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/colingagnon/weakgame-api
go run bin/main.go -d="weakgame-api" -u="weakgame" -h="localhost" -P="3306"
```

You will be asked for the password for this db user.

#### Usage

```
# Starts basic server
go run bin/main.go -d="weakgame-api" -u="weakgame" -h="localhost" -P="3306"

```

#### About this repository
This repository was originally created to be used in a "hack day" for a project management class.  The students are given 1 working day to try and complete some of the additional features. At this point this is super rough, mostly intentionally, but I could see it being developed as a way to test skills for the interview process, or as a rather tool for current employees.
